# Biography
I am a sophomore in Computer Engineering and Mathematics with a minor in Physics at Purdue University.

I'm deeply interested in software engineering and reinforcement learning. I'm doing multi-agent reinforcement learning research at Purdue, and am a contributor to several open-source reinforcement learning libraries, including OpenAI Gym, PettingZoo, and RLlib.

I'm looking for SWE/ML internships for Summer 2022. In my free time, I can be found playing squash or the piano.

# Projects
## Neural-MMO @ Purdue
I'm currently supervising an undergraduate research team at Purdue research multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for the [Neural-MMO Challenge](https://jsuarez5341.github.io/neural-mmo/build/html/rst/userguide.html). I assign tasks and explain recent papers in deep reinforcement learning for a team of eight undergraduate and graduate students. I also implement reinforcement learning algorithms with Attention and Long-Short Term Memory and run distributed hyperparameter tuning using Ray and RLlib.

## Purdue Machine Learning Reading Group
I'm organizing the reinforcement learning seminars for the Purdue [ML Reading Group](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/MLreading.html). My responsibilities include selecting the papers, organizing the presentations, and presenting at the first two meetings, where I'm giving a concise introduction to deep reinforcement learning and the [Rainbow-DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298) paper respectively.

## Project Boom
Since July 2020, I've been an Avionics Team Member at [Project Boom](https://theprojectboom.org/), an international student organization dedicated to creating the first student-built supersonic aerial vehicle. I've been developing our simulation and control stack using JSBSim, PX4, and ArduPilot (written in Python and C++).
