# Biography
I am a sophomore in Computer Engineering with minors in Mathematics and Physics at Purdue University. I'm also interning at Anyscale over Summer 2022!

I'm interested in software engineering and reinforcement learning. I'm doing multi-agent reinforcement learning research at Purdue, and am a contributor to several open-source reinforcement learning libraries, including OpenAI Gym, PettingZoo, and RLlib.

In my free time, I can be found playing squash or the piano.
