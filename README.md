# Biography
I am a junior in Computer Engineering with minors in Mathematics and Physics at Purdue University. I'm also currently interning at Anyscale. I am interested in full-time roles starting May 2023.

I'm passionate about software engineering and reinforcement learning, and am a contributor to several open-source reinforcement learning libraries, including OpenAI Gym, PettingZoo, and RLlib.

In my free time, I can be found climbing, playing squash, or at the piano.
